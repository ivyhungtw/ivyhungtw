### Hello world ðŸ‘‹

Here's a little bit about myself and why I decided to change my career.

I learned programming to enhance my digital marketing skills at first, hoping to find more efficient ways to perform day-to-day tasks. However, the deeper I dive into the world of web development, the more attractive it seems to be. 

When working on the [Simple Twitter project](https://github.com/ivyhungtw/simple-twitter-api), I stayed in front of the computer for over 12 hours a day without getting tired or bored. After finishing the project, I felt satisfied like never before, and I realized that I prefer building a product to marketing it. Thatâ€™s why I become a web developer.

#### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

- [Ecommerce Website](https://github.com/ivyhungtw/ecommerce-site): Collaborate with another full-stack developer to build an e-commerce website for customers to shop latest trends in women's clothing.
- [Full-stack Web Development Study Group](https://github.com/ivyhungtw/full-stack-web-dev-study-group): A group of four hold study groups to share knowledge and discuss questions related to full-stack web development every two weeks.

#### ðŸŒ± My tech stack:

- Frondend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript(ES6), Bootstrap, RWD, Ajax(axios)
- Backend: RESTful API, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars, MongoDB(mongoose), MySQL(sequelize), ERD Model Design, MVC Framework
- Others: Git, Github, Heroku, Postman, Socket.IO, Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics, Facebook Ads/Google Ads, SEO, Trello, Slack
